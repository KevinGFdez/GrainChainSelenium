# Grain chain test selenium

## Run test

Execute the [SearchTest.xml](SearchTest.xml)

## Html reports (Allure)

To view the html report we have to open a terminal and execute the command:
Allure serve "Absolute path of the HTML report"

Example:

```sh
Allure serve E:\Automation\Appium\GrainChainAppium\test-output
```
The html report must open in our default browse.


**Note:** We have to have Allure installed on our computer.
